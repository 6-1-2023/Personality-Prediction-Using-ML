## Personality Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques <br>
Putting writing aside, I implemented what was described in the paper from start to finish (from preprocessing to model building and prediction). My coauthors each built different systems on their own and what eventually was written about was the one I createdâ€”using various libraries at each stage (NumPy, pandas, PyTorch, Huggingface's Transformers, etc.). 

## I wrote at least pages 40/67 of the paper, specifically: <br>

### And per the pdf page numbering: 
1-10 (10 pages) <br>
15-24 (10 pages) <br>
38 <br>
45-47 (3 pages) <br>
52-66 (15 pages) <br>
11: Only the "Chapter 2: Background" paragraph <br>  
14: "2.2 Natural Language Processing" & "2.2.1 A brief and general history of Natural Language Processing" <br>
28: Only the last paragraph (In mathematical terms...) <br>
29: The entire page except for the last paragraph ("Can we apply this concept to examples in our real world?") <br>
36: The 1st paragraph only (Chapter 3: Literature Review) <br>
43: The entire page except for "4.1 Preprocessing" <br>
44: The "4.4 XLNet" paragraph only <br>
 <br>
67-75: The references we all helped create <br>
